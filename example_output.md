@Alex @Emma Let's implement dark mode! Here's the design mockup from our designer:

![Dark Mode Design Mockup](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400/6366f1/ffffff?text=Dark+Mode+Design+Mockup)

Key requirements:
- Toggle in settings menu
- Respect system preferences by default
- Smooth CSS transitions (300ms)
- Store preference in localStorage

  Great! I'll start with the theme context provider. We should use CSS variables for colors to make this maintainable.

  ```javascript
  const themes = {
    light: {
      '--bg-primary': '#ffffff',
      '--text-primary': '#1a1a1a'
    },
    dark: {
      '--bg-primary': '#1a1a1a',
      '--text-primary': '#ffffff'
    }
  }
  ```

  I'll handle the UI components. Found this reference implementation:

  Should we also add an "auto" option that follows system theme?

**↳ Sarah Chen** - 2024-03-12 15:00

  @Emma Yes! Let's have three options:
  - Light
  - Dark
  - System (default)

Created a React context that:
- Detects system preference on load
- Persists user choice to localStorage
- Provides `useTheme()` hook for components
- Handles CSS variable injection

  Fixed the Edge transition issue. It was a CSS specificity problem. Updated PR.
